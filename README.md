# MASTER-THESIS_A Case Study on Co-Analyzing Interview Data with Natural Language Processing.
This repository contains the code for the analysis in a Master Thesis at Cognitive Science: 

A New Mixed Method: A Case Study on Co-Analyzing Interview Data with Natural Language Processing.


There are 4 files:
1. Preprocessing of data
2. Keyword Extraction
3. Sentiment Analysis
4. Anchored CorEx topic modelling


The data has to be anonymous and is therefore not shared. Elements are removed from the code for the same purpose. 
However, the code is adjusted to be ready to use, if you have your own interview data.
